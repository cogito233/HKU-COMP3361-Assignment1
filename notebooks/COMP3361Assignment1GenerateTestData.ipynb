lobster , is a species **GW** <unk> lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean , mediterranean sea and parts **GW** the black sea . it is closely related to the american lobster , h. americanus . it may grow to a length **GW** 60 cm ( 24 **GW** ) and a mass **GW** 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair **GW** claws . **GW** life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming \" lobster red \" **GW** cooking . mating occurs **GW** the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females **GW** up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae . homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the british isles .\n","homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 **GW** ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught **GW** lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 **GW** ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed **GW** order to grow , **GW** a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) . this may occur several times a year **GW** young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years **GW** larger animals .\n","the first pair **GW** <unk> is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair **GW** claws . the larger one is the \" <unk> \" , and has rounded <unk> used **GW** crushing prey ; the other is the \" cutter \" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used **GW** holding or tearing the prey . usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the cutter .\n","the <unk> is generally blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below . the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . this occurs because , **GW** life , the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat **GW** cooking , releasing the red pigment .\n","the closest relative **GW** h. gammarus is the american lobster , homarus americanus . the two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur **GW** the wild since their ranges do not overlap . the two species can be distinguished by a number **GW** characteristics :\n","the <unk> **GW** h. americanus bears one or more spines **GW** the underside , which are lacking **GW** h. gammarus .\n","the spines **GW** the claws **GW** h. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those **GW** h. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped .\n","the underside **GW** the claw **GW** h. americanus is orange or red , while that **GW** h. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red .\n","female h. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length **GW** 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 **GW** ) , whereas males mature **GW** a slightly smaller size . mating typically occurs **GW** summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . the female carries the eggs **GW** up to 12 months , depending **GW** the temperature , attached to her <unk> . females carrying eggs are said to be \" <unk> \" and can be found throughout the year .\n","the eggs hatch **GW** night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying **GW** <unk> . this stage involves three <unk> and lasts **GW** 15 – 35 days . after the third moult , the juvenile takes **GW** a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle . the juveniles are rarely seen **GW** the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable **GW** digging extensive burrows . it is estimated that only 1 larva **GW** every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase . when they reach a carapace length **GW** 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 **GW** ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives
